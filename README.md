# Visual Analytics Portfolio Spring 2021
### Magnus Bendix Borregaard

This repository contains assignment 1, 2, and 3 of my 2021 spring semester Visual Analytics portfolio, but not the self-chosen assignment (the self-chosen assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/NormalReedus/cds-visual-project "GitHub")).

Every assignment will have its own directory as such:
```bash
.
├── assignment_1
├── assignment_2
└── assignment_3
```

Each assignment will have their own virtual environment in their respective project root directories to avoid dependency conflicts.
